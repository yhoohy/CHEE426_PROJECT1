    "\n",
    "This Project 2 covers the development of a Classifier to predict the Approval (or Non-approval) by FDA (Food and Drug Administration) of Drugs by training the model on molecular data. It involves concepts and techniques from the Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 of the textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also a project where you will compete with each other via **Kaggle** to deveop the best Classifier for this project. Hence, this project has its Kaggle competition page were you will submit your notebook and your predictions to a Test Set that only I know the correct labels (true Y). Therefore, your Kaggle performance from this project will be counted as a seatwork - this is separate from your project grade even though we use the same problem for **Project** and seatwork **Competition** via Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Is Expected of You Given We Have this Template Notebook?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Having this template notebook for the project, your task then is to improve the model. Here are possible ways to improve the model according to the discussion of our textbook author:\n",
    " - (1) Use only a subset of the X variables.\n",
    " - (2) Transform some of the X variables.\n",
    " - (3) Use models other than Logistic Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Referring to (3), you may also use techniques not covered by the textbook (note that the textbook is focused on few project examples - few examples but deep analysis and good demo) and there are many algorithms out there other than Logistic Regression to  develop a Classfier.\n",

    "where $f(z)$ is the **sigmoid** function. The variable $z$ is the linear model wherein we estimate the model parameters $w$ such that: $z=wX=w_{0} + \\sum_{i=1}^n w_{i}X_{i}$. Recall the dot-product: $wX$. The molecular descriptors are the model inputs $X_{i}$, which are the data in the dataframe **features** we created above. The sigmoid has a domain of $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ and outputs a probability $(0, 1)$. The input to the sigmoid can be viewed as log-odds, called **logits** for short. Odds are ratios of probability -- odds of 1 means the probability of the class 1 is 0.5 and class 0 is 0.5. Odds of 2 means the probability of class 1 is 0.67 and class 0 is 0.33. Log-odds is the natural logarithm of that, so that log-odds of 0 means the odds are 1 and the output probability should be 0.5. One definition of the sigmoid is \n",

    "however in practice there are some complexities to implementing sigmoids to make sure they're numerically stable. This type of binary classifier is sometimes called **logistic regression** because we're regressing logits. \n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, all we've done is replacing the inequality of the perceptron with a smooth differentiable version. Just like previously, a positive number indicated class 1 (FDA approved) but now it's a continuum of numbers from 0.5 to 1.0. This is **soft** classification -- we give probabilities of class membership instead of hard assignment. However, our loss function now needs to be modified as well. \n",

    "Instead of writing our own code to perform logistic regression, we will use the pre-built function in Scikit-Learn as shown by the textbook author (Chapter 3 and 4): **from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression**. \n",
